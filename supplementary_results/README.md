## Overview

We present typical results, for all three problems given in the paper. We note that we only show results that used adaptive random-walk proposals with 10 replicas and maximum of 10 000 samples for each case  shown in [exp_results](https://github.com/intelligentEarth/pt-Bayeslands/tree/master/supplementary_results/exp_results)  folder. 

Within this folder, you can find the Badlands predictions eg. [pred_plots]() and the posterior for the different parameters eg. [pos_plots](). 

Details of our experimentation study, using high performance computing using up to 48 cores is shown in bayeslands_runs.xlsx and previous version of results (not in published paper), is shown in [bayeslandsRuns_2018results.pdf](https://github.com/intelligentEarth/pt-Bayeslands/blob/master/supplementary_results/bayeslandsRuns_2018results.pdf)
